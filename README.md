This repo holds my godot projects

I am currently working on Pumlets 3D, a multiplayer class-based game in which a player can move both up and down, left and right, and forwards and backwards.
When I am finished implementing the base game, I will get to work on the core of the Pumlets idea, which is to build a game community with a close feedback loop to the game from the very beginning in the hopes of making it more fun for more players for as long as possible.
