TODO list overview:

ChubbyCaterpillar0
	-ChubbyCharacter
		-multiplayer interpolate velocity as well as position
	-layer and mask setting, support for up to 10 teams

ChubbyServer0
	-Misc
		-move character files into gamecharacters folder
	-ChubbyPhantom
		-finish object syncing

Misc (long term goals)
	-networking
		-tweens for interpolation
		**impractical, probably allows hacks, solved by simpler algs-Lstm trained on client-server prediction to make game big smooth
			-preprocessing of how many "Game objects" the player currently sees (a number, X)
			-preprocessing of object attributes to small numbers between -1 and 1
			-profile of every single player 
			-l1: a recurrent neural network (RNN) runs X times, each takes inputs describing object type, position, health, shape bounds, shape type, current velocity, etc... might not even need current velocity
			-l2: an lstm which takes past object values to predict the server's next packet sent
			-Potentially even predicts gameplay moves, like when someone is likely to activate an ability
	-final optimizations
		-threading for physics processing
		-polish sprites
		-animations
		-sounds
